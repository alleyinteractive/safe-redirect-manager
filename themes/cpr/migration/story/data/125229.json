The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration burst through the door of Chong&rsquo;s California home with their weapons drawn. He was dubbed the &ldquo;Pope of Pot&rdquo; because his &quot;Chong Bongs&quot; for smoking marijuana were shipped across state lines to undercover federal agents.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Chong was sentenced to nine months in federal prison.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">That was then.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Now, with a book to his name about his time behind bars and fresh off a stint on ABC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dancing With the Stars,&rdquo; Chong is coming to Colorado. It&#39;s part of a tour to promote a line of marijuana called &quot;Chong Star.&quot;<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Celebrities hawking pot, endorsing its legalization, or simply saying they smoke it is more evidence of what Ricardo Baca calls the &ldquo;normalization&rdquo; of marijuana culture. Baca is the editor of The Denver Post&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cannabist.&rdquo;<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">One part of the picture is how celebrities -- or their families -- are putting their famous names on products.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">In another example, the family of Bob Marley has reached an agreement with an equity firm in Seattle to create Marley Natural, &ldquo;a premium cannabis brand rooted in the life and legacy&rdquo; of the reggae star who died in 1981, NBC&rsquo;s &quot;Today&quot; recently reported. The products include pot-infused creams, vaporizers, and strains of &ldquo;heirloom Jamaican cannabis,&rdquo; according to the talk show.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">The list of celebrities somehow associating their names with pot seems to be growing. Whoopi Goldberg is writing a sporadic column for The Cannabist. And actor Seth Rogen last week used Twitter to invite Coloradans to come and &ldquo;smoke weed&rdquo; with him during a Denver screening of &ldquo;The Interview,&rdquo; his latest movie.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">However, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cpr.org\/news\/story\/seth-rogens-get-baked-movie-screening-denver-takes-hit\">Denver Film Society told CPR News reporter Ben Markus<\/a> that the screening at the SIE FilmCenter was canceled. Markus and Rogen exchanged a series of tweets during the aftermath in which Rogen left the door open for a screening to take place elsewhere. When Markus inquired where that would be, Rogen tweeted, &ldquo;You&#39;ll see..&rdquo;<\/p><p>If the event is invite-only, it <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cpr.org\/news\/story\/want-get-high-seth-rogen-colorado-it-s-complicated\" target=\"_self\">could be legal<\/a> under the law.<\/p>","summary":"From Seth Rogen to Tommy Chong to Whoopi Goldberg, more celebrity names are going to pot.
