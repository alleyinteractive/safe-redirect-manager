Several members, including Wells, also compose. Member Caroline Shaw won the 2013 Pulitzer prize for Classical composition for her piece Partita for 8 Voices, which the ensemble recorded. (When she&#39;s not singing or writing music, Shaw also plays violin in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cpr.org\/classical\/story\/listen-american-contemporary-music-ensemble-acme-and-johann-johannsson-cpr\">ACME, the American Contemporary Music Ensemble<\/a>.)<\/p><p>The octet also works with composers like Caleb Burhans, Merrill Garbus of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cpr.org\/tags\/tune-yards\">tUnE-yArDs<\/a>, and&nbsp;William Brittelle. The group&nbsp;recently recorded a second disc, due in April . &nbsp;<\/p><ul style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><li><strong>Check back soon for footage of Roomful of Teeth performing Caroline Shaw&rsquo;s Partita for 8 Voices in the CPR Performance Studio.<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>Roomful of Teeth performs at 7:30 p.m. Friday at the Newman Center on the DU campus, with accompaniment by members of the Colorado Symphony.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Wells and Shaw spoke with CPR Classical about how they describe the octet&#39;s&nbsp;vocal textures, the <a href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/IZ4LCejQg8o?t=2m56s\" target=\"_blank\">Bulgarian choir<\/a> that helped inspire the group and what to expect from their next album. Click the audio above to listen.&nbsp;Interview highlights:<\/p><p><strong>Wells on how the group likes to approach its music with the attitude of a band, rather than a choir:<\/strong><\/p><p>&quot;There&rsquo;s a formality around choirs, the same as there&rsquo;s a formality around orchestras. And there&rsquo;s an informality (around bands). You&rsquo;re in somebody&rsquo;s living room or you&rsquo;re in somebody&rsquo;s garage, making the music you love -- as opposed to, you&rsquo;re doing it for a service or you&rsquo;re doing it for a concert series. &hellip; I think that&rsquo;s part of the spirit that we really like in the group.&quot;<\/p><p><strong>Shaw on how the&nbsp;singers describe the musical sounds they want to create:<\/strong><\/p><p>&quot;I find metaphors and strange comparisons work really well. Food is usually a good one. I think we&rsquo;ve talked about lasagna and salty food and sweet food, and different kinds of textures. I think it&rsquo;s a really fun way to think about sound and music -- and especially when you&rsquo;re working with vocal colors that are sort of different from what a lot of us do in our other choral jobs. It&rsquo;s fun to get outside of &nbsp;the traditional vocabulary.&quot;<\/p><p><strong>Wells on how learning new vocal techniques is vital to the ensemble&rsquo;s work -- and a lifelong pursuit:<\/strong><\/p><p>&quot;It is key to our existence. &hellip; &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a big wide world of singing out there and I think if Roomful of Teeth lasted for the rest of our lives, we would barely have started.&quot;<\/p><p><em>Check out the group&#39;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/event\/music\/362098751\/roomful-of-teeth-tiny-desk-concert\" target=\"_blank\">Tiny Desk Concert<\/a> from NPR.<\/em><\/p>","summary":"Composer and singer Caroline Shaw and director Brad Wells talk about the group's inspirations and next record.","format":"full_html"}]},"field_author":{"und":[{"target_id":"99193"}]},"field_image":[],"field_audio":{"und":[{"target_id":"131628"}]},"field_video":[],"field_slideshow":[],"field_related_content":{"und":[{"target_id":"101527"},{"target_id":"102860"},{"target_id":"102491"}]},"field_topics":{"und":[{"target_id":"18861"}]},"field_story_type":[],"field_tags":{"und":[{"tid":"4995"}]},"field_feature_action_text":{"und":[{"value":"Listen","format":null,"safe_value":"Listen"}]},"field_feature_space_eligibility":{"und":[{"value":"1"}]},"field_secondary_services":{"und":[{"target_id":"14"}]},"field_feature_image":{"und":[{"target_id":"131626"}]},"field_song_of_the_week":[],"field_primary_service":{"und":[{"target_id":"10336"}]},"field_feature_supporting_copy":{"und":[{"value":"<p>Composer and singer Caroline Shaw and director Brad Wells talk about the group&#39;s inspirations and next record.<\/p>","format":"full_html"}]},"field_npr_ingest_id":[],"field_popularity_radioactivity":[],"field_document":[],"field_google_editors_pick":{"und":[{"value":"0"}]},"field_google_news":{"und":[{"value":"0"}]},"field_google_news_genres":[],"field_npr_ingest_image2":[],"field_npr_audio":[],"field_push_to_npr_one":[],"field_push_to_npr":[],"_drafty_revision_requested":"FIELD_LOAD_CURRENT","metatags":{"und":{"robots":{"value":{"0":0,"index":0,"follow":0,"noindex":0,"nofollow":0,"noarchive":0,"nosnippet":0,"noodp":0,"noydir":0}}}},"path":{"pid":"256231","source":"node\/131627","alias":"classical\/story\/interview-roomful-teeth-brings-world-vocal-sounds-newman-center","language":"und","pathauto":"1"},"rdf_mapping":{"rdftype":["sioc:Item","foaf:Document"],"title":{"predicates":["dc:title"]},"created":{"predicates":["dc:date","dc:created"],"datatype":"xsd:dateTime","callback":"date_iso8601"},"changed":{"predicates":["dc:modified"],"datatype":"xsd:dateTime","callback":"date_iso8601"},"body":{"predicates":["content:encoded"]},"uid":{"predicates":["sioc:has_creator"],"type":"rel"},"name":{"predicates":["foaf:name"]},"comment_count":{"predicates":["sioc:num_replies"],"datatype":"xsd:integer"},"last_activity":{"predicates":["sioc:last_activity_date"],"datatype":"xsd:dateTime","callback":"date_iso8601"}},"name":"bturner","picture":"0","data":"b:0;","workbench_moderation":{"current":{"hid":"216494","vid":"312935","nid":"131627","from_state":"published","state":"published","uid":"1218","stamp":"1425623955","published":"1","is_current":1,"title":"Interview: Roomful of Teeth brings a world of vocal sounds to the Newman Center","timestamp":"1425623955"},"published":{"hid":"216494","vid":"312935","nid":"131627","from_state":"published","state":"published","uid":"1218","stamp":"1425623955","published":"1","is_current":1,"title":"Interview: Roomful of Teeth brings a world of vocal sounds to the Newman Center","timestamp":"1425623955"},"my_revision":{"hid":"216494","vid":"312935","nid":"131627","from_state":"published","state":"published","uid":"1218","stamp":"1425623955","published":"1","is_current":1,"title":"Interview: Roomful of Teeth brings a world of vocal sounds to the Newman Center","timestamp":"1425623955"}}}
