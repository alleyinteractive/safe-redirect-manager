He and his partner Riley are one of just three teams in Colorado able to quickly gather what could be key evidence in those crimes.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Riley is an &ldquo;arson dog&quot; whose job it is to sniff out traces of gasoline, lighter fluid and other accelerants criminals may use to cover up their acts.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&quot;[Arson dogs] take the guesswork out of where we need to take the samples,&quot; Means says, talking about forensic work he does at crime scenes.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Last year, there were 807 arsons across Colorado, causing nearly $4 million in lost property, and arson dogs may work hundreds of fires a year.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.66667em;\">Besides Riley, one of the state&#39;s other arson dogs also&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/arsondog.org\/about\/active-teams\/active-teams-colorado\/\" style=\"line-height: 1.66667em;\">works for the CBI, and the third works for the Longmont Fire Department<\/a><span style=\"line-height: 1.66667em;\">.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In April, Means&#39; previous partner, Sadie, retired. She <span style=\"line-height: 1.66667em;\">served for<\/span><span style=\"line-height: 1.66667em;\">&nbsp;seven years and approximately 500 fires.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Means recalls many of them, including the time Sadie, a black labrador, played a key role in helping solve the murders of three children in Colorado Springs.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Both mom and dad were prosecuted for that case,&rdquo; Means says, and sentenced to life behind bars.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.66667em;\">Sadie was also &quot;quite an ambassador for the state of Colorado,&rdquo; Means says. And in<\/span><span style=\"line-height: 1.66667em;\">&nbsp;2011, Sadie was named the Top Law Enforcement\/Arson Dog in the United States by the American Humane Association. She also received a Golden Paws Award from the MaxFund no-kill shelter.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Along the way Sadie became a model. Her likeness was enshrined at the National Fire Dog Monument in Washington, D.C. She also traveled to Hollywood, where she mingled with big celebrities, including actress Betty White.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sadie is healthy, but was getting stiff in her hips, so was retired. Sadie was the Means&rsquo; family dog before joining the CBI. Means sought the okay to have Sadie trained as arson dog. Now Sadie has returned to the family and is living with Means&rsquo; adult daughter, who also works in fire enforcement.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sadie&rsquo;s replacement, Riley, does not have the same prestigous past. But the new job is a second chance of sorts for him.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Riley dropped out of seeing<span style=\"line-height: 1.66667em;\">-eye-school, but Means says Riley&#39;s skills are better suited to arson investigations, including an incredibly keen sense of smell.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.66667em;\">Riley, who covers CBI&rsquo;s northern Colorado zone, including Denver,&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"line-height: 1.66667em;\">attended an intensive national training program with Means run by the state police in Maine, and he&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"line-height: 1.66667em;\">graduated from Arson K-9 School in May. He&#39;s already responded to nearly 20 fires, including a suspected double murder.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Riley is with Means around the clock, but Means says the transition hasn&rsquo;t been flawless.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had my wife&rsquo;s anniversary flowers trashed from one end of the house to the other and him sitting in the middle with physical evidence on his forehead,&rdquo; Means says.<\/p>\r\n","summary":"Riley the \"arson dog\" has big paws to fill: award-winning Sadie, who flirted with Hollywood fame, is retiring and Riley's taking over.","format":"full_html"}]},"field_author":{"und":[{"target_id":"108418"}]},"field_image":{"und":[{"target_id":"117295"},{"target_id":"117296"},{"target_id":"117297"},{"target_id":"117298"}]},"field_audio":{"und":[{"target_id":"117288"}]},"field_video":[],"field_slideshow":{"und":[{"target_id":"117300"}]},"field_related_content":[],"field_topics":{"und":[{"target_id":"18864"}]},"field_story_type":{"und":[{"tid":"70"}]},"field_tags":{"und":[{"tid":"932"},{"tid":"4240"}]},"field_feature_action_text":[],"field_feature_space_eligibility":{"und":[{"value":"1"}]},"field_secondary_services":[],"field_feature_image":{"und":[{"target_id":"117296"}]},"field_song_of_the_week":[],"field_primary_service":{"und":[{"target_id":"14"}]},"field_feature_supporting_copy":{"und":[{"value":"<p>Riley the &quot;arson dog&quot; has big paws to fill: award-winning Sadie, who flirted with Hollywood fame, is retiring and Riley&#39;s taking over.<\/p>\r\n","format":"full_html"}]},"field_npr_ingest_id":[],"field_popularity_radioactivity":[],"field_document":[],"field_google_editors_pick":{"und":[{"value":"0"}]},"field_google_news":{"und":[{"value":"1"}]},"field_google_news_genres":[],"field_npr_ingest_image2":[],"field_npr_audio":[],"field_push_to_npr_one":[],"field_push_to_npr":[],"_drafty_revision_requested":"FIELD_LOAD_CURRENT","metatags":{"und":{"robots":{"value":{"0":0,"index":0,"follow":0,"noindex":0,"nofollow":0,"noarchive":0,"nosnippet":0,"noodp":0,"noydir":0}}}},"path":{"pid":"236090","source":"node\/117292","alias":"news\/story\/seeing-eye-dog-school-dropout-nabs-top-canine-cop-job","language":"und","pathauto":"1"},"rdf_mapping":{"rdftype":["sioc:Item","foaf:Document"],"title":{"predicates":["dc:title"]},"created":{"predicates":["dc:date","dc:created"],"datatype":"xsd:dateTime","callback":"date_iso8601"},"changed":{"predicates":["dc:modified"],"datatype":"xsd:dateTime","callback":"date_iso8601"},"body":{"predicates":["content:encoded"]},"uid":{"predicates":["sioc:has_creator"],"type":"rel"},"name":{"predicates":["foaf:name"]},"comment_count":{"predicates":["sioc:num_replies"],"datatype":"xsd:integer"},"last_activity":{"predicates":["sioc:last_activity_date"],"datatype":"xsd:dateTime","callback":"date_iso8601"}},"name":"mdeyoanna","picture":"0","data":"b:0;","workbench_moderation":{"current":{"hid":"281363","vid":"286083","nid":"117292","from_state":"published","state":"published","uid":"2845","stamp":"1503663243","published":"1","is_current":1,"title":"Seeing-eye-dog-school dropout nabs top canine cop job","timestamp":"1503663243"},"published":{"hid":"281363","vid":"286083","nid":"117292","from_state":"published","state":"published","uid":"2845","stamp":"1503663243","published":"1","is_current":1,"title":"Seeing-eye-dog-school dropout nabs top canine cop job","timestamp":"1503663243"},"my_revision":{"hid":"281363","vid":"286083","nid":"117292","from_state":"published","state":"published","uid":"2845","stamp":"1503663243","published":"1","is_current":1,"title":"Seeing-eye-dog-school dropout nabs top canine cop job","timestamp":"1503663243"}}}
