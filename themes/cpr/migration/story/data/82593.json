Dog owners aren&rsquo;t cleaning up after their pets. The county&rsquo;s gotten more and more complaints lately. Jeffco's animal control manager, Carla Zinanti, says it got so bad in one place that the school district had to move a bus stop because the kids couldn't play. There are laws on the books about this,&nbsp; but enforcing them&rsquo;s really hard&nbsp; because you have to catch the&nbsp;&nbsp; dog owner, and the dog, in the act. That is, pooping --&nbsp; and walking away without scooping. So, to combat the problem, Jefferson County officials had to take another approach.
