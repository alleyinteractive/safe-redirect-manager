The design would include a memorial path replicating the river bend where more than 600&nbsp;U.S. volunteer soldiers attacked an encampment of Cheyenne and Arapahoe as they slept in present-day Kiowa County. About 200 of them, mostly women and children, were brutally slaughtered.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">The path would lead&nbsp;to a set of bronze teepee poles, a statue of a woman collapsed in grief, and a large horizontal medicine wheel.<\/p><ul dir=\"ltr\"><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cpr.org\/news\/story\/150-years-after-sand-creek-massacre-its-effects-still-resonate\" target=\"_blank\">150 Years After Sand Creek Massacre, Effects Still Resonate<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cpr.org\/news\/story\/hickenlooper-offers-apology-sand-creek-massacre-150th-anniversary\" target=\"_blank\">Hickenlooper&nbsp;Offers Apology For&nbsp;Massacre on&nbsp;150th Anniversary<\/a>&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul><p dir=\"ltr\">Gov.&nbsp;John Hickenlooper has thrown his support behind the project and will host a fundraiser at the governor&rsquo;s mansion Tuesday night. The monument is expected to cost $194,000 to design and construct, with more than half that money pledged by the Arsenault Family Foundation.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">But raising money is only one of the obstacles the proposal faces. So far, the committee tasked with approving new monuments for the&nbsp;grounds is giving the idea a cool reception.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">When the proposal was presented at a Nov.&nbsp;20&nbsp;hearing of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.colorado.gov\/pacific\/cga-legislativecouncil\/capitol-building-advisory\" target=\"_blank\">Capitol Building Advisory Committee<\/a>, the list of concerns was long: the size, the placement, the impact on the overall design of the capitol grounds, and the potential for people to misuse offerings left by tribal members, especially ceremonial tobacco.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Committee member Frank McNulty laid out a number of elements he&rsquo;d like to see revised.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;A smaller footprint, a display that lends itself to easier maintenance. Something that doesn&#39;t by its very nature and construction lend itself to vandalism and mischief,&rdquo; said McNulty. &ldquo;And one that doesn&#39;t present safety hazards for people who are using the Capitol grounds.&rdquo;<\/p><h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Righting Historic Wrong<\/strong><\/h3><p dir=\"ltr\">For descendants of the Cheyenne and Arapahoe tribes brutalized at Sand Creek, though, a large, public memorial would be an act of healing.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The results of it are being felt even today,&rdquo; said David Halaas, a former state historian who has written about Sand Creek and is a consultant for the tribes. &ldquo;It&#39;s an open wound, it&#39;s a very living thing... This horrific event has to be talked about, has to be known.&rdquo;<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">[[nid:124720 field_align=full-width]]Sand Creek is already remembered on one Capitol monument. The large Civil War memorial on the western plaza lists the Battle of Sand Creek, perpetuating a historical whitewashing of the event that persisted for more than a century. In 1999 the state Legislature added a bronze plaque to the monument to correct the record.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Supporters of a separate monument, though, feel more acknowledgement is needed, especially since Colorado&rsquo;s territorial government was deeply complicit in the massacre.<\/p><ul dir=\"ltr\"><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cpr.org\/news\/story\/report-early-colo-governor-has-significant-level-culpability-sand-creek-massacre\" target=\"_blank\">Report: Early&nbsp;Governor&#39;s &#39;Significant Level of Culpability&#39; At&nbsp;Sand Creek<\/a><\/li><\/ul><p dir=\"ltr\">Halaas is both part of the memorial organizing effort and a member of the Capitol Building&nbsp;Advisory Committee and says he was taken aback by the panel&rsquo;s opposition.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;We may have to scale back a bit,&rdquo; said Halaas, &ldquo;but there are some elements that have to be in there. We&rsquo;ll just have to see. I think some of the committee has to be educated about Sand Creek.&rdquo;<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">This is likely to be the start of a long process. The Advisory Committee only votes on proposed monuments once a year, at its summer meeting, and isn&rsquo;t known for approving new ones.<\/p>","summary":"Descendants of the victims of the Sand Creek Massacre are raising funds and pushing forward with plans for an elaborate monument.
