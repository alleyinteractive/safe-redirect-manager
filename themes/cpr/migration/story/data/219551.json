A surprise bill can also happen when someone is treated at an out-of-network facility or provider in an emergency.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zoe Williams of Denver spoke at a press conference in favor of the bill Thursday.&nbsp;Williams said she took her 3-year-old to an emergency room at an out-of-network hospital for a broken leg. The bill was $15,000.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;All of these accounts went to collections, it impacted our credit,&rdquo; Williams said. &ldquo;I had actually just found out I was accepted into law school, and almost had to not go to school because I couldn&#39;t qualify for my loans, which required a certain amount of credit in order to access them.&quot;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ilse Wagner of Broomfield also spoke in favor of the bill. She had surgery and was billed $625 for the services of an out-of-network surgical assistant. The tab arrived even after she had been assured she wouldn&#39;t be charged for that service.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That people&#39;s credit scores get ruined by surprise bills that are difficult to fight, absolutely it happens all the time,&rdquo; Wagner said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are cases where insurers have been charged 200 or 300 times what Medicare pays for the same services, said Adam Fox, director of strategic engagement for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cohealthinitiative.org\/\">Colorado Consumer Health Initiative<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You heard that right, they&rsquo;ve been charged more than $200,000 when Medicare would pay $520 for the same service,&rdquo; Fox said. &ldquo;Or $70,000 when Medicare would have paid $338.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fox said those high costs get passed on to consumers through higher premiums.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;More and more Colordans are getting hit by surprise out-of-network bills,&rdquo; said<br \/>\r\n\tRep. Daneya Esgar, D-Pueblo, one of the bill&rsquo;s sponsors. &ldquo;These are not one-off stories, but the ones many Coloradans have experienced, too many Coloradans.&rdquo;<br \/>\r\n\t&nbsp;<br \/>\r\n\tSimilar measures have failed in prior legislative sessions.<\/p>\r\n","summary":"So-called \"balance billing\" or \"surprise bills\" often happens when a patient goes to an in-network facility but is treated by an out-of-network provider.","format":"full_html"}]},"field_author":{"und":[{"target_id":"96807"}]},"field_image":[],"field_audio":[],"field_video":[],"field_slideshow":[],"field_related_content":{"und":[{"target_id":"219195"},{"target_id":"218333"},{"target_id":"216832"}]},"field_topics":{"und":[{"target_id":"18863"}]},"field_story_type":[],"field_tags":{"und":[{"tid":"9664"},{"tid":"2631"},{"tid":"8894"},{"tid":"2034"},{"tid":"2674"}]},"field_feature_action_text":[],"field_feature_space_eligibility":{"und":[{"value":"1"}]},"field_secondary_services":[],"field_feature_image":{"und":[{"target_id":"219550"}]},"field_song_of_the_week":[],"field_primary_service":{"und":[{"target_id":"14"}]},"field_feature_supporting_copy":{"und":[{"value":"<p>So-called &quot;balance billing&quot; or &quot;surprise bills&quot; often happens when a patient goes to an in-network facility but is treated by an out-of-network provider.<\/p>\r\n","format":"full_html"}]},"field_npr_ingest_id":[],"field_popularity_radioactivity":[],"field_document":[],"field_google_editors_pick":{"und":[{"value":"0"}]},"field_google_news":{"und":[{"value":"1"}]},"field_google_news_genres":[],"field_npr_ingest_image2":[],"field_npr_audio":[],"field_push_to_npr_one":{"und":[{"value":"0"}]},"field_push_to_npr":{"und":[{"value":"0"}]},"metatags":{"und":{"robots":{"value":{"0":0,"index":0,"follow":0,"noindex":0,"nofollow":0,"noarchive":0,"nosnippet":0,"noodp":0,"noydir":0,"noimageindex":0,"notranslate":0}}}},"path":{"pid":"359314","source":"node\/219551","alias":"news\/story\/ever-have-an-unexpectedly-costly-medical-bill-state-lawmakers-want-to-prevent-that","language":"und","pathauto":"1"},"rdf_mapping":{"rdftype":["sioc:Item","foaf:Document"],"title":{"predicates":["dc:title"]},"created":{"predicates":["dc:date","dc:created"],"datatype":"xsd:dateTime","callback":"date_iso8601"},"changed":{"predicates":["dc:modified"],"datatype":"xsd:dateTime","callback":"date_iso8601"},"body":{"predicates":["content:encoded"]},"uid":{"predicates":["sioc:has_creator"],"type":"rel"},"name":{"predicates":["foaf:name"]},"comment_count":{"predicates":["sioc:num_replies"],"datatype":"xsd:integer"},"last_activity":{"predicates":["sioc:last_activity_date"],"datatype":"xsd:dateTime","callback":"date_iso8601"}},"name":"ascoville","picture":"0","data":"b:0;","workbench_moderation":{"current":{"hid":"318346","vid":"470866","nid":"219551","from_state":"draft","state":"published","uid":"3673","stamp":"1549587830","published":"1","is_current":1,"title":"Ever Have An Unexpectedly Costly Medical Bill?
