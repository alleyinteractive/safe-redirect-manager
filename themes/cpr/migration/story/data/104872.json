They&rsquo;re very strongly committed to their art. They&rsquo;re very strongly committed to themselves as a group, as a community. &hellip;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s going to take some work on both of our parts so we get to know each other and to develop that trust and vulnerability so that when we stop onstage in front of an audience we&rsquo;re able to take leaps of faith and to trust that we&rsquo;re there for each other.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>On his goal of developing Kantorei as a recording artist:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>&quot;To step into a recording session where you&rsquo;re pulling in top-flight recording engineers and producers really changes the ensemble. You are under a microscope, and coming out of the recording process, the artistic level - through the 20 hours of being under that microscope - is twice as good coming out the other side.&quot;<\/p>\r\n<p>Here is Rinsema conducting &ldquo;O Magnum Mysterium&rdquo; with the Phoenix Chorale:<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"embed\">[[nid:104870 field_align=center]]<\/div>\r\n<p><em>David Rutherford hosts weekday afternoons from 12:30 to 4 p.m. on CPR Classical, and Sacred Classics from 6 to 10 a.m. Sundays.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n","summary":"David Rutherford interviews the Denver choral group\u2019s new artistic director.","format":"full_html"}]},"field_author":{"und":[{"target_id":"453"}]},"field_image":{"und":[{"target_id":"104629"}]},"field_audio":{"und":[{"target_id":"104871"}]},"field_video":{"und":[{"target_id":"104870"}]},"field_slideshow":[],"field_related_content":{"und":[{"target_id":"104627"},{"target_id":"100376"}]},"field_topics":[],"field_story_type":[],"field_tags":{"und":[{"tid":"5196"},{"tid":"5198"}]},"field_feature_action_text":[],"field_feature_space_eligibility":{"und":[{"value":"1"}]},"field_secondary_services":{"und":[{"target_id":"10336"}]},"field_feature_image":{"und":[{"target_id":"104629"}]},"field_song_of_the_week":[],"field_primary_service":{"und":[{"target_id":"10336"}]},"field_feature_supporting_copy":{"und":[{"value":"<p>David Rutherford interviews the Denver choral group&rsquo;s new artistic director.<\/p>\r\n","format":"full_html"}]},"field_npr_ingest_id":[],"field_popularity_radioactivity":[],"field_document":[],"field_google_editors_pick":[],"field_google_news":[],"field_google_news_genres":[],"field_npr_ingest_image2":[],"field_npr_audio":[],"field_push_to_npr_one":[],"field_push_to_npr":[],"_drafty_revision_requested":"FIELD_LOAD_CURRENT","metatags":{"und":{"robots":{"value":{"0":0,"index":0,"follow":0,"noindex":0,"nofollow":0,"noarchive":0,"nosnippet":0,"noodp":0,"noydir":0}}}},"path":{"pid":"218685","source":"node\/104872","alias":"classical\/story\/joel-rinsema-talks-big-plans-kantorei","language":"und","pathauto":"1"},"rdf_mapping":{"rdftype":["sioc:Item","foaf:Document"],"title":{"predicates":["dc:title"]},"created":{"predicates":["dc:date","dc:created"],"datatype":"xsd:dateTime","callback":"date_iso8601"},"changed":{"predicates":["dc:modified"],"datatype":"xsd:dateTime","callback":"date_iso8601"},"body":{"predicates":["content:encoded"]},"uid":{"predicates":["sioc:has_creator"],"type":"rel"},"name":{"predicates":["foaf:name"]},"comment_count":{"predicates":["sioc:num_replies"],"datatype":"xsd:integer"},"last_activity":{"predicates":["sioc:last_activity_date"],"datatype":"xsd:dateTime","callback":"date_iso8601"}},"name":"bturner","picture":"0","data":"b:0;","workbench_moderation":{"current":{"hid":"181425","vid":"262713","nid":"104872","from_state":"published","state":"published","uid":"1218","stamp":"1394428182","published":"1","is_current":1,"title":"Joel Rinsema talks big plans for Kantorei","timestamp":"1394428182"},"published":{"hid":"181425","vid":"262713","nid":"104872","from_state":"published","state":"published","uid":"1218","stamp":"1394428182","published":"1","is_current":1,"title":"Joel Rinsema talks big plans for Kantorei","timestamp":"1394428182"},"my_revision":{"hid":"181425","vid":"262713","nid":"104872","from_state":"published","state":"published","uid":"1218","stamp":"1394428182","published":"1","is_current":1,"title":"Joel Rinsema talks big plans for Kantorei","timestamp":"1394428182"}}}
