For a&nbsp;single mother with one child, making minimum wage in Colorado, the credit amounts to a $1.59-an-hour raise over the course of the year.&nbsp;<\/p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">3. What happens to the families who get it<\/h3><p dir=\"ltr\">By arriving as a single lump sum, the credit also functions something like an instant savings account for workers living paycheck to paycheck, allowing them to make big purchases they otherwise couldn&rsquo;t afford.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">[[nid:134528 field_align=left]]Mariah Herrera has big plans for her EITC. An assistant manager at a Denver dollar store, Herrera and her 14-month-old son live with her grandparents. She wants to use the $5,000 she&rsquo;s getting to pay off old bills and improve her credit rating, the first step to bigger changes.<\/p><p class=\"normal\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: rgb(64, 69, 64); line-height: 30.0000591278076px;\">&ldquo;I want to start looking for a place,&rdquo; said Herrera, as her son snoozed in his stroller at a free tax preparation site, &ldquo;get everything together and start a better life for him.&rdquo;<\/span><\/p><p class=\"normal\" dir=\"ltr\">Research shows that children in families that get larger tax credits <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chicagofed.org\/publications\/working-papers\/2013\/wp-14\" target=\"_blank\">are healthier<\/a>, do <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w11279.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">better in grade school<\/a>, and are slightly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.msu.edu\/~maxfiel7\/20131114%20Maxfield%20EITC%20Child%20Education.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">more likely to go to college<\/a>.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The effect on the kids and others who are in the family over the long run is actually pretty extraordinary,&rdquo; said Rich Jones with the Bell Policy Center, a progressive advocacy group.<\/p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">4. The high cost of helping people<\/h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The EITC has one big&nbsp;and very expensive&nbsp;flaw: Around a quarter of payments go to people who don&rsquo;t qualify for them.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">The IRS estimates incorrect payments cost the government around $14.5 billion a year. A lot of those may be innocent filing errors due to the complexity of claiming the credits. But with so much money available, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-soi\/EITCComplianceStudyTY2006-2008.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">fraudulent filings are also a concern<\/a>.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">On the other end of the spectrum, t<span style=\"color: rgb(64, 69, 64); line-height: 30.0000591278076px;\">he IRS estimates that in 2010,&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.eitc.irs.gov\/EITC-Central\/Participation-Rate\" style=\"line-height: 30.0000591278076px;\" target=\"_blank\">28 percent&nbsp;of eligible&nbsp;Coloradans&nbsp;missed out<\/a><span style=\"color: rgb(64, 69, 64); line-height: 30.0000591278076px;\">&nbsp;on the&nbsp;<\/span>EITC<span style=\"color: rgb(64, 69, 64); line-height: 30.0000591278076px;\">.<\/span><\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;It&#39;s a mess,&rdquo; said Linda Goram with the Independence Institute, a Denver-based free market think tank. &ldquo;If you&#39;re doing a tax system, you probably should just use it for a tax system and not try to make it an anti-poverty program.&rdquo;<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Before his election to the U.S. Senate last year, Colorado Republican Cory Gardner introduced a bill in the U.S. House that would have&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/bill\/113th-congress\/house-bill\/5070\" target=\"_blank\">increased&nbsp;the penalties for fraudulently claiming an EITC, or helping someone to do so<\/a>. The legislation never went anywhere, but the IRS continues to push Congress to give it more authority to go after problematic filers.<\/p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">5. Colorado&rsquo;s getting in the game<\/h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Love it or hate it, Colorado is getting in on the Earned Income Tax Credit concept. The state is poised to<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cpr.org\/news\/story\/changes-colorados-earned-income-tax-credit\"> start offering an EITC of its own<\/a>, giving workers up to 10 percent of whatever they get from the federal government.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">The state EITC is already on the books, but it won&rsquo;t go into effect until the Colorado&rsquo;s TABOR surplus is large enough to cover the cost, an estimated $84 million a year.<\/p><ul dir=\"ltr\" style=\"color: rgb(64, 69, 64); line-height: 30.0000591278076px;\"><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cpr.org\/news\/topic\/tabor\" target=\"_blank\">More proposed tax credits and how they could affect your TABOR refund<\/a><\/li><\/ul><p dir=\"ltr\">Analysts differ on how soon that might happen; economists in the governor&rsquo;s office estimate those checks could go out as soon as next spring while the Legislature&rsquo;s number&nbsp;crunchers think it won&rsquo;t be until 2017.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">Once it is active, Colorado will offer the credit permanently, regardless of whether the state is running a TABOR surplus in a given year.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">This means Colorado is likely to experience both the good of the EITC &ndash; the improved childhood outcomes that higher tax credits brings &ndash; and the bad &ndash; millions wasted on improper payments &ndash; in the coming years.<\/p>","summary":"In 2013, 358,000 low-income Coloradans claimed the Earned Income Tax Credit, receiving $777 million total.
