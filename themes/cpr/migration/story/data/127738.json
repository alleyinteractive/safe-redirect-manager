It&rsquo;s one more step in the group&rsquo;s climb to national notoriety.<\/p><p>SHEL is an acronym for the names of the four sisters who make up the band: Sarah (fiddle), Hannah (keys), Eva (lead vocals and mandolin),&nbsp;and Liza (percussion) Holbrook.<\/p><p>Before and after the She Rocks Awards, which will also feature Grammy winner Colbie&nbsp;Caillat, SHEL&nbsp;will bring its mix of&nbsp;bluegrass,&nbsp;folk, pop and rock to Denver (Saturday&nbsp;at the Bluebird)&nbsp;and Fort Collins (Jan. 30 at Hodi&#39;s Half Note).&nbsp;<\/p><p>The four sisters are between the ages of 21-26, and they get at least some of their musical talent from their father, songwriter Andrew Holbrook. Sarah says their dad pushed the three older sisters&nbsp;to drop out of college and pursue music. Their mom had a harder time with that decision.<\/p><p>&quot;But she embraced it,&quot; Sarah says. &quot;She trusted us to be okay.&quot;<\/p><p>Liza, the youngest, was still in high school when SHEL formed.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&quot;We just threw her in the van and didn&rsquo;t really give her an option,&quot; Sarah says.<\/p><p>The group is working on their second album, which Sarah expects will be released this spring, called &quot;Laboratory Sessions.&quot;<\/p><p>In addition to making albums and touring around the U.S. and Europe, SHEL produces videos for almost every song. Sarah shoots and edits many of them. And, the group&#39;s music has been featured on television shows and movies, including the film &quot;The Best of Me,&quot; based on a book by Nicholas Sparks, who also wrote &quot;The Notebook.&quot;&nbsp;<\/p><p>Sarah says developing a following on YouTube and being on&nbsp;television and&nbsp;movie soundtracks&nbsp;helps expose the group to a broader audience -- one that may not otherwise&nbsp;pick up a SHEL album.<\/p><p>&quot;We&#39;re just a tiny machine, even with a [record] label,&quot; she says.&nbsp;<\/p><p>The band is also starting a collaboration with Dave Stewart of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qeMFqkcPYcg\" target=\"_blank\">the Eurythmics<\/a>. Sarah expects that as a result, SHEL will put out more new music&nbsp;in 2016 with a stronger electronic influence.<\/p><p>[[nid:127737 field_align=center]]<\/p>","summary":"Folk group SHEL, made up of four sisters, is generating buzz with new songs, self-produced videos and appearances on TV and movie soundtracks.","format":"full_html"}]},"field_author":{"und":[{"target_id":"66214"}]},"field_image":[],"field_audio":{"und":[{"target_id":"127807"}]},"field_video":{"und":[{"target_id":"127737"}]},"field_slideshow":[],"field_related_content":{"und":[{"target_id":"113795"},{"target_id":"96792"},{"target_id":"65800"}]},"field_topics":{"und":[{"target_id":"18861"}]},"field_story_type":{"und":[{"tid":"70"}]},"field_tags":{"und":[{"tid":"723"},{"tid":"5754"}]},"field_feature_action_text":[],"field_feature_space_eligibility":{"und":[{"value":"1"}]},"field_secondary_services":{"und":[{"target_id":"16"}]},"field_feature_image":{"und":[{"target_id":"127734"}]},"field_song_of_the_week":[],"field_primary_service":{"und":[{"target_id":"14"}]},"field_feature_supporting_copy":{"und":[{"value":"<p>Folk group SHEL, made up of four sisters, is generating buzz with new songs, self-produced videos and appearances on TV and movie soundtracks.<\/p>","format":"full_html"}]},"field_npr_ingest_id":[],"field_popularity_radioactivity":[],"field_document":[],"field_google_editors_pick":{"und":[{"value":"0"}]},"field_google_news":{"und":[{"value":"1"}]},"field_google_news_genres":[],"field_npr_ingest_image2":[],"field_npr_audio":[],"field_push_to_npr_one":[],"field_push_to_npr":[],"_drafty_revision_requested":"FIELD_LOAD_CURRENT","metatags":{"und":{"robots":{"value":{"0":0,"index":0,"follow":0,"noindex":0,"nofollow":0,"noarchive":0,"nosnippet":0,"noodp":0,"noydir":0}}}},"path":{"pid":"250679","source":"node\/127738","alias":"news\/story\/harmony-stage-and-behind-scenes-fort-collins-sister-act-shel","language":"und","pathauto":"1"},"rdf_mapping":{"rdftype":["sioc:Item","foaf:Document"],"title":{"predicates":["dc:title"]},"created":{"predicates":["dc:date","dc:created"],"datatype":"xsd:dateTime","callback":"date_iso8601"},"changed":{"predicates":["dc:modified"],"datatype":"xsd:dateTime","callback":"date_iso8601"},"body":{"predicates":["content:encoded"]},"uid":{"predicates":["sioc:has_creator"],"type":"rel"},"name":{"predicates":["foaf:name"]},"comment_count":{"predicates":["sioc:num_replies"],"datatype":"xsd:integer"},"last_activity":{"predicates":["sioc:last_activity_date"],"datatype":"xsd:dateTime","callback":"date_iso8601"}},"name":"restabrook","picture":"0","data":"b:0;","workbench_moderation":{"current":{"hid":"212323","vid":"306849","nid":"127738","from_state":"needs_review","state":"published","uid":"333","stamp":"1421964175","published":"1","is_current":1,"title":"Harmony on stage and behind the scenes for Fort Collins sister act SHEL","timestamp":"1421964175"},"published":{"hid":"212323","vid":"306849","nid":"127738","from_state":"needs_review","state":"published","uid":"333","stamp":"1421964175","published":"1","is_current":1,"title":"Harmony on stage and behind the scenes for Fort Collins sister act SHEL","timestamp":"1421964175"},"my_revision":{"hid":"212323","vid":"306849","nid":"127738","from_state":"needs_review","state":"published","uid":"333","stamp":"1421964175","published":"1","is_current":1,"title":"Harmony on stage and behind the scenes for Fort Collins sister act SHEL","timestamp":"1421964175"}}}
