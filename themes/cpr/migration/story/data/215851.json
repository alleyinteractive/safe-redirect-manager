It&rsquo;s kind of what we&rsquo;re dealing with with precipitation,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest federal <a href=\"https:\/\/droughtmonitor.unl.edu\/\">drought map<\/a> shows some improvements along the Rio Grande Valley in New Mexico, but dryness has expanded in parts of southern California and parts of Nevada.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along the Nevada-California border, the Tahoe area on Thursday received more than a foot of snow, prompting the National Weather Service to issue a backcountry avalanche warning for most of the central mountain chain there.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forecasters said the winter snowpack for Colorado&rsquo;s Front Range, northern Arizona and other areas also was looking promising but the El Nino pattern has yet to develop. Wetter-than-average conditions usually take hold during an El Nino winter and higher elevations can get more snow.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>While temperatures in the Pacific Ocean have been on the mark for a couple of months now, rainfall levels and atmospheric conditions aren&rsquo;t quite right yet.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mike Halpert, deputy director of the Climate Prediction Center, said forecasters still expect the pattern to develop as winter approaches and it could last into the spring.<\/p>\r\n","summary":"The epicenter of the nation's drought has been centered for months now over the region where Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah meet.","format":"full_html"}]},"field_author":{"und":[{"target_id":"107628"}]},"field_image":[],"field_audio":[],"field_video":[],"field_slideshow":[],"field_related_content":{"und":[{"target_id":"215329"},{"target_id":"215611"},{"target_id":"213820"}]},"field_topics":{"und":[{"target_id":"131895"}]},"field_story_type":[],"field_tags":{"und":[{"tid":"3943"},{"tid":"745"},{"tid":"9650"},{"tid":"1553"},{"tid":"8575"},{"tid":"7975"},{"tid":"6380"}]},"field_feature_action_text":[],"field_feature_space_eligibility":{"und":[{"value":"1"}]},"field_secondary_services":[],"field_feature_image":{"und":[{"target_id":"215849"}]},"field_song_of_the_week":[],"field_primary_service":{"und":[{"target_id":"14"}]},"field_feature_supporting_copy":{"und":[{"value":"<p>The epicenter of the nation&#39;s drought has been centered for months now over the region where Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah meet.<\/p>\r\n","format":"full_html"}]},"field_npr_ingest_id":[],"field_popularity_radioactivity":[],"field_document":{"und":[{"target_id":"215850"}]},"field_google_editors_pick":{"und":[{"value":"0"}]},"field_google_news":{"und":[{"value":"1"}]},"field_google_news_genres":[],"field_npr_ingest_image2":[],"field_npr_audio":[],"field_push_to_npr_one":{"und":[{"value":"0"}]},"field_push_to_npr":{"und":[{"value":"0"}]},"_drafty_revision_requested":"FIELD_LOAD_CURRENT","path":{"pid":"355529","source":"node\/215851","alias":"news\/story\/four-corners-remains-parched-as-el-ni-o-teases","language":"und","pathauto":"1"},"rdf_mapping":{"rdftype":["sioc:Item","foaf:Document"],"title":{"predicates":["dc:title"]},"created":{"predicates":["dc:date","dc:created"],"datatype":"xsd:dateTime","callback":"date_iso8601"},"changed":{"predicates":["dc:modified"],"datatype":"xsd:dateTime","callback":"date_iso8601"},"body":{"predicates":["content:encoded"]},"uid":{"predicates":["sioc:has_creator"],"type":"rel"},"name":{"predicates":["foaf:name"]},"comment_count":{"predicates":["sioc:num_replies"],"datatype":"xsd:integer"},"last_activity":{"predicates":["sioc:last_activity_date"],"datatype":"xsd:dateTime","callback":"date_iso8601"}},"name":"jhill","picture":"0","data":"b:0;","workbench_moderation":{"current":{"hid":"314280","vid":"464340","nid":"215851","from_state":"published","state":"published","uid":"2845","stamp":"1543602786","published":"1","is_current":1,"title":"Four Corners Remains Parched As El Ni\u00f1o Teases","timestamp":"1543602786"},"published":{"hid":"314280","vid":"464340","nid":"215851","from_state":"published","state":"published","uid":"2845","stamp":"1543602786","published":"1","is_current":1,"title":"Four Corners Remains Parched As El Ni\u00f1o Teases","timestamp":"1543602786"},"my_revision":{"hid":"314280","vid":"464340","nid":"215851","from_state":"published","state":"published","uid":"2845","stamp":"1543602786","published":"1","is_current":1,"title":"Four Corners Remains Parched As El Ni\u00f1o Teases","timestamp":"1543602786"}}}
