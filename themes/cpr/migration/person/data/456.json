Mom. Dad. Midwestern public schools. A couple of universities, a broadcast school, countless libraries, bookstores and most importantly, a lifelong interest in learning about and listening to music.<br \/>\r\n\t<br \/>\r\n\t<strong>Professional background:<\/strong><br \/>\r\n\tRichard&#39;s journey to Colorado Public Radio is an interesting one. He got his start in radio in 1972 at a CBS affiliate in Missoula and after a stop over in Albuquerque, he arrived in Colorado just in time to join the team putting Boulder&#39;s KBCO on the air in 1977. After 16 years as the mid-day DJ and Sunday night jazz show host, he accepted an entirely different challenge. In 1993 he became the program director of a children&#39;s radio station in Denver, (Kid Radio), followed by a couple of years as the production director at 96.5 The Peak.<br \/>\r\n\t<br \/>\r\n\t<strong>Why I got into radio:<\/strong><br \/>\r\n\tI grew up in a small town in northern Iowa and fell in love with radio listening to my little transistor picking up AM stations late at night from far away places like Chicago and Oklahoma City. Story telling and music are still magic to me. Radio is indeed the most visual medium.<br \/>\r\n\t<br \/>\r\n\t<strong>How I ended up at CPR:<\/strong><br \/>\r\n\tI&#39;ve been listening to Colorado Public Radio since the early 1980s. In 1998 I had a chance to join the Classical Public Radio Network while it was still in its formative period. In July 2008 I was offered the opportunity to host an afternoon music program. I love the music, the audience, and the mission of Colorado Public Radio.
