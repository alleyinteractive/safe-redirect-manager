# SCSS (styles) directory

This directory should contain SCSS not associated with any one specific entry point or component. This could include core SCSS utilities or global resets.

## Style linting

There is a linter! Listen to it! Docs are [here](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint). Also, the existing linter config is only a sensible set of defaults; the front-end lead should feel free add to the config as the project requires.
