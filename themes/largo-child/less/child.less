/**
 * Largo Sample Child Theme
 * =======================
 * Looking for homepage Styles, they're over here:
 *    /homepages/less
 *
 * The LESS files included here are combined and compiled into /css/child.css and /css/child.min.css
 * Run 'grunt watch' from the root of the child directory to "watch" these files for changes
 * This will recomplile the main stylesheet for your child theme anytime you save your work
 *
 */


@import "variables.less"; // 1.1 - any LESS variables you use in your other LESS files belong here


/**
 * If you have any custom LESS mixins they belong here
 * Check Largo first to see if the mixin you need already exists before adding it here
 * Uncomment if needed
 */

// @import "utilities.less"; // 1.2 - mixins 


@import "_global.less"; // 2.0 - general styles for layout, reusable components, classes, etc. go here


/**
 * For more complicated child themes you may want to break your LESS up into discrete files
 * Uncomment any of the following as needed to include them in your main stylesheet
 */

// @import "_typography.less"; // 4.0 - typography

// @import "_header.less"; // 3.0 - styles for the header

// @import "_single.less"; // 5.0 - any styles pertaining just to single posts or pages

// @import "_archive.less"; // 6.0 - any styles specific to archive (category/tag/author/taxonomy/etc) pages

// @import "_footer.less"; // 7.0 - styles for the footer

// @import "_shame.less"; // 8.0 - hacks, stuff to fix later, CSS that is bad and should feel bad
